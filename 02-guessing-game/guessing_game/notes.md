### Chapter 2

- In rust, variables are **immutable** by default.
- To make a mutable variable, we write `mut` before the variable name.
For example, `let mut bananas = 5;`.
- Like C programming language, `//` starts a line comment.
- `String::new` indicates that `new` is an *associated function* of the `String` type. This is a function that is implemented on a atype.
